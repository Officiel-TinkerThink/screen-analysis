{"result": "The image shows a computer screen with various open windows. On the left side of the screen, there is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with code editors and terminals open, suggesting that someone may be working on software development tasks. The code editor shows a file structure with source code files, and there are text-based commands or error messages indicating a compilation process or a debugging session.\n\nOn the right side of the screen, there is a screenshot of a mobile device displaying a user interface (UI) for an application or website. The UI includes text fields and buttons, with some input already provided. Additionally, there's a message or notification at the top of the UI that reads \"ANALYSIS CREATED,\" followed by an attachment thumbnail.\n\nThe overall setup implies that the user is multitasking between coding on one side and interacting with an application or website on the other, possibly to test, debug, or analyze changes made to the software in development.", "timestamp": "2025-08-22T10:15:57.880125Z", "level": "info", "event": "Image analyzed successfully"}
